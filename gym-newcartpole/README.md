# New Cartpole for OpenAI GYM 

This is a testing environment for learning how to implement customized versions of GYM environments 

The sole difference two this environment and the "Standard" OpenAI Gym CartpoleV0 is substitution for the predefined dynamics of the cartpole with the a derivation of the cartpole dynamics performed myself using Lagrange Equations.
